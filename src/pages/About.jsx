        Shanti Gyan Niketan Sr. Sec. Public School (SGNS), established in 1989, stands as a beacon of academic excellence and holistic development in the region. Founded by the visionary Shri Raj Kumar Khurana, SGNS was born from a dream to provide value-based education that empowers students not only intellectually but also morally and socially. Over the decades, SGNS has cultivated an environment where tradition meets innovation. The school has consistently delivered stellar results in CBSE board examinations, along with notable achievements in national-level competitive exams like NEET and JEE. At the same time, the institution emphasizes character-building, leadership, sportsmanship, and creativity through a rich array of co-curricular activities. With a dedicated leadership team, dynamic faculty, and a progressive vision, SGNS continues to mold young minds into responsible citizens who are equipped to contribute meaningfully to society. The school’s motto is not just to teach, but to inspire—and this has remained its guiding force for over 35 years.
